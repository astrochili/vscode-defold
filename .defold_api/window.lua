window.WINDOW_EVENT_FOCUS_GAINED = nil

---This event is sent to a window event listener when the game window or app screen has lost focus.
window.WINDOW_EVENT_FOCUS_LOST = nil

---   This event is sent to a window event listener when the game window or app screen is

window.WINDOW_EVENT_ICONFIED = nil

---This event is sent to a window event listener when the game window or app screen is resized.

window.WINDOW_EVENT_RESIZED = nil

---  Returns the current dimming mode set on a mobile device.
---The dimming mode specifies whether or not a mobile device should dim the screen after a period without user interaction.

---@return constant mode The mode for screen dimming
---
---window.DIMMING_UNKNOWN
---window.DIMMING_ON
---window.DIMMING_OFF
---
function window.get_dim_mode() end

---This returns the current lock state of the mouse cursor
---@return boolean state The lock state
function window.get_mouse_lock() end

---This returns the current window size (width and height).
---@return number width The window width
---@return number height The window height
function window.get_size() end

---  Sets the dimming mode on a mobile device.
---The dimming mode specifies whether or not a mobile device should dim the screen after a period without user interaction. The dimming mode will only affect the mobile device while the game is in focus on the device, but not when the game is running in the background.
