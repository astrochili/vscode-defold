---Constructor-like function with two purposes:
---Load the specified resource as part of loading the script
---Return a hash to the run-time version of the resource
--- This function can only be called within go.property function calls.
---@param path? string optional resource path string to the resource
---@return hash path a path hash to the binary version of the resource
function resource.atlas(path) end

---Constructor-like function with two purposes:
---Load the specified resource as part of loading the script
---Return a hash to the run-time version of the resource
--- This function can only be called within go.property function calls.
---@param path? string optional resource path string to the resource
---@return hash path a path hash to the binary version of the resource
function resource.buffer(path) end

---This function creates a new atlas resource that can be used in the same way as any atlas created during build time.
---The path used for creating the atlas must be unique, trying to create a resource at a path that is already
---registered will trigger an error. If the intention is to instead modify an existing atlas, use the resource.set_atlas
---function. Also note that the path to the new atlas resource must have a '.texturesetc' extension,
---meaning "/path/my_atlas" is not a valid path but "/path/my_atlas.texturesetc" is.
---When creating the atlas, at least one geometry and one animation is required, and an error will be
---raised if these requirements are not met. A reference to the resource will be held by the collection
---that created the resource and will automatically be released when that collection is destroyed.
---Note that releasing a resource essentially means decreasing the reference count of that resource,
---and not necessarily that it will be deleted.
---@param path string The path to the resource.
---@param table table A table containing info about how to create the texture. Supported entries:
---
---
---
---texture
---string | hash the path to the texture resource, e.g "/main/my_texture.texturec"
---
---
---
---
---animations
---table a list of the animations in the atlas. Supports the following fields:
---
---
---
---
---id
---string the id of the animation, used in e.g sprite.play_animation
---
---
---
---
---width
---integer the width of the animation
---
---
---
---
---height
---integer the height of the animation
---
---
---
---
---frame_start
---integer index to the first geometry of the animation. Indices are lua based and must be in the range of 1 ..  in atlas.
---
---
---
---
---frame_end
---integer index to the last geometry of the animation (non-inclusive). Indices are lua based and must be in the range of 1 ..  in atlas.
---
---
---
---
---playback
---constant optional playback mode of the animation, the default value is go.PLAYBACK_ONCE_FORWARD
---
---
---
---
---fps
---integer optional fps of the animation, the default value is 30
---
---
---
---
---flip_vertical
---boolean optional flip the animation vertically, the default value is false
---
---
---
---
---flip_horizontal
---boolean optional flip the animation horizontally, the default value is false
---
---
---
---
---geometries
---table A list of the geometries that should map to the texture data. Supports the following fields:
---
---
---
---
---vertices
---table a list of the vertices in texture space of the geometry in the form {px0, py0, px1, py1, ..., pxn, pyn}
---
---
---
---
---uvs
---table a list of the uv coordinates in texture space of the geometry in the form of {u0, v0, u1, v1, ..., un, vn}
---
---
---
---
---indices
---table a list of the indices of the geometry in the form {i0, i1, i2, ..., in}. Each tripe in the list represents a triangle.
---
---
---
---@return hash path Returns the atlas resource path
function resource.create_atlas(path, table) end

---This function creates a new buffer resource that can be used in the same way as any buffer created during build time.
---The function requires a valid buffer created from either buffer.create or another pre-existing buffer resource.
---By default, the new resource will take ownership of the buffer lua reference, meaning the buffer will not automatically be removed
---when the lua reference to the buffer is garbage collected. This behaviour can be overruled by specifying 'transfer_ownership = false'
---in the argument table. If the new buffer resource is created from a buffer object that is created by another resource,
---the buffer object will be copied and the new resource will effectively own a copy of the buffer instead.
---Note that the path to the new resource must have the '.bufferc' extension, "/path/my_buffer" is not a valid path but "/path/my_buffer.bufferc" is.
---The path must also be unique, attempting to create a buffer with the same name as an existing resource will raise an error.
---@param path string The path to the resource.
---@param table table A table containing info about how to create the buffer. Supported entries:
---
---
---
---buffer
---buffer the buffer to bind to this resource
---
---
---
---
---transfer_ownership
---boolean optional flag to determine wether or not the resource should take over ownership of the buffer object (default true)

---Sets the resource data for a specific resource
---@param path string|hash The path to the resource
---@param buffer buffer_data The buffer of precreated data, suitable for the intended resource type
function resource.set(path, buffer) end

---Sets the data for a specific atlas resource. Setting new atlas data is specified by passing in
---a texture path for the backing texture of the atlas, a list of geometries and a list of animations
---that map to the entries in the geometry list. The geometry entries are represented by three lists:
---vertices, uvs and indices that together represent triangles that are used in other parts of the
---engine to produce render objects from.
---Vertex and uv coordinates for the geometries are expected to be
---in pixel coordinates where 0,0 is the top left corner of the texture.
---There is no automatic padding or margin support when setting custom data,
---which could potentially cause filtering artifacts if used with a material sampler that has linear filtering.
---If that is an issue, you need to calculate padding and margins manually before passing in the geometry data to
---this function.

function resource.set_atlas(path, table) end

---Sets the buffer of a resource. By default, setting the resource buffer will either copy the data from the incoming buffer object
---to the buffer stored in the destination resource, or make a new buffer object if the sizes between the source buffer and the destination buffer
---stored in the resource differs. In some cases, e.g performance reasons, it might be beneficial to just set the buffer object on the resource without copying or cloning.
---To achieve this, set the transfer_ownership flag to true in the argument table. Transferring ownership from a lua buffer to a resource with this function
---works exactly the same as resource.create_buffer: the destination resource will take ownership of the buffer held by the lua reference, i.e the buffer will not automatically be removed
---when the lua reference to the buffer is garbage collected.
---Note: When setting a buffer with transfer_ownership = true, the currently bound buffer in the resource will be destroyed.
