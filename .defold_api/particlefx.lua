---@class particlefx

---The emitter is not spawning any particles, but has particles that are still alive.
particlefx.EMITTER_STATE_POSTSPAWN = nil

---The emitter will be in this state when it has been started but before spawning any particles. Normally the emitter is in this state for a short time, depending on if a start delay has been set for this emitter or not.
particlefx.EMITTER_STATE_PRESPAWN = nil

---The emitter does not have any living particles and will not spawn any particles in this state.
particlefx.EMITTER_STATE_SLEEPING = nil

---The emitter is spawning particles.
particlefx.EMITTER_STATE_SPAWNING = nil

---Starts playing a particle FX component.
---Particle FX started this way need to be manually stopped through particlefx.stop().
---Which particle FX to play is identified by the URL.
--- A particle FX will continue to emit particles even if the game object the particle FX component belonged to is deleted. You can call particlefx.stop() to stop it from emitting more particles.
---@param url string|hash|url the particle fx that should start playing.
---@param emitter_state_function fun(self, id, emitter, state)|nil optional callback function that will be called when an emitter attached to this particlefx changes state.
---
---self
---object The current object
---id
---hash The id of the particle fx component
---emitter
---hash The id of the emitter
---state
---constant the new state of the emitter:
---
---
---particlefx.EMITTER_STATE_SLEEPING
---particlefx.EMITTER_STATE_PRESPAWN
---particlefx.EMITTER_STATE_SPAWNING
---particlefx.EMITTER_STATE_POSTSPAWN
---
function particlefx.play(url, emitter_state_function) end

---Resets a shader constant for a particle FX component emitter.
---The constant must be defined in the material assigned to the emitter.
---Resetting a constant through this function implies that the value defined in the material will be used.
---Which particle FX to reset a constant for is identified by the URL.
---@param url string|hash|url the particle FX that should have a constant reset
---@param emitter string|hash the id of the emitter
---@param constant string|hash the name of the constant
function particlefx.reset_constant(url, emitter, constant) end

---Sets a shader constant for a particle FX component emitter.
---The constant must be defined in the material assigned to the emitter.
---Setting a constant through this function will override the value set for that constant in the material.
---The value will be overridden until particlefx.reset_constant is called.
---Which particle FX to set a constant for is identified by the URL.
---@param url string|hash|url the particle FX that should have a constant set
---@param emitter string|hash the id of the emitter
---@param constant string|hash the name of the constant
---@param value vector4 the value of the constant
function particlefx.set_constant(url, emitter, constant, value) end

---Stops a particle FX component from playing.
---Stopping a particle FX does not remove already spawned particles.
---Which particle FX to stop is identified by the URL.
---@param url string|hash|url the particle fx that should stop playing
---@param options table Options when stopping the particle fx. Supported options:
---
---boolean clear: instantly clear spawned particles
---
function particlefx.stop(url, options) end
