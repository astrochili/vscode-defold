---This is only supported for numerical properties. If the node property is already being
---animated, that animation will be canceled and replaced by the new one.
---If a complete_function (lua function) is specified, that function will be called when the animation has completed.
---By starting a new animation in that function, several animations can be sequenced together. See the examples for more information.
--- If you call go.animate() from a game object's final() function,
---any passed complete_function will be ignored and never called upon animation completion.
---See the properties guide for which properties can be animated and the animation guide for how
---them.

---Delete one or more game objects identified by id. Deletion is asynchronous meaning that
---the game object(s) are scheduled for deletion which will happen at the end of the current
---frame. Note that game objects scheduled for deletion will be counted against
---max_instances in "game.project" until they are actually removed.
--- Deleting a game object containing a particle FX component emitting particles will not immediately stop the particle FX from emitting particles. You need to manually stop the particle FX using particlefx.stop().

---Returns or constructs an instance identifier. The instance id is a hash

---This function defines a property which can then be used in the script through the self-reference.
---The properties defined this way are automatically exposed in the editor in game objects and collections which use the script.
---Note that you can only use this function outside any callback-functions like init and update.
---@param name string the id of the property
---@param value number|hash|url|vector3|vector4|quaternion|resource_data|boolean default value of the property. In the case of a url, only the empty constructor msg.url() is allowed. In the case of a resource one of the resource constructors (eg resource.atlas(), resource.font() etc) is expected.

---Sets the parent for a game object instance. This means that the instance will exist in the geometrical space of its parent,
---like a basic transformation hierarchy or scene graph. If no parent is specified, the instance will be detached from any parent and exist in world
---space.
---This function will generate a set_parent message. It is not until the message has been processed that the change actually takes effect. This
---typically happens later in the same frame or the beginning of the next frame. Refer to the manual to learn how messages are processed by the
---engine.
