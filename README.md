# How to turn Visual Studio Code into Defold IDE

This guide will help you to configure [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for developing games with [Defold](https://defold.com/).

- [x] Syntax **Highlighting** and **Linting**.
- [x] Powerful **IntelliSense** (standard lua, Defold API, libraries, project code).
- [x] **Building** and **Launching** the game from VSCode.
- [x] **Debugging** with breakpoints, call stacks, stepping, inspecting and evaluating.
- [x] **Bundling** to all the platforms and **Deploying** to connected mobile devices.

This allows you not to use Defold Editor at all if you are only working with code at the moment.

ðŸ’¬ [Discuss on the forum](https://forum.defold.com/t/guide-how-to-turn-vscode-into-defold-ide-with-debugger/68002).

## Download

#### Start form the scratch

- Use this repository [as the template](https://github.com/astrochili/defold-vscode-guide/generate) or download [master](https://github.com/astrochili/defold-vscode-guide/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) as your starting project.

#### Or integrate to your existing project

- Copy `debugger`, `.vscode`, `.defold_api`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore` to your existing project folder.

## Setup

#### MacOS / Linux / Windows

1. Install recommended by the workspace [extensions](#extensions) on the VSCode Extensions pane.
2. Configure path to your Defold Editor by replacing `YOUR-DEFOLD-PATH-HERE` in [.vscode/defold.sh](.vscode/defold.sh#L11).
3. Set VSCode as the [custom editor](#custom-editor) in Defold preferences.
4. Add the debugger starting code to your project:

```lua
require('debugger.debugger').start()
```

#### Windows (additional steps)

5. Install `bash` following [this instruction](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994/6352765).

### What's next

Now you can open tasks list with **[Ctrl/Cmd]-Shift-B** (by default) or launch the game to debug with **F5** (by default). Also you can **[Ctrl/Cmd]-Alt-I** to format your code.

You can change [key bindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) in the VSCode settings.

## Extensions

These extentions are listed in workspace recommendations so it shouldn't be a problem to install them quickly in the VSCode Extensions pane.

- [sumneko.lua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) - A powerful Lua language server with IntelliSense.
- [tomblind.local-lua-debugger-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomblind.local-lua-debugger-vscode) - A nice local debugger for Lua.
- [thejustinwalsh.textproto-grammer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thejustinwalsh.textproto-grammer) - Textual Protobuf syntax highlighting.
- [slevesque.shader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.shader) - Shader languages support.
- [dtoplak.vscode-glsllint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dtoplak.vscode-glsllint) - Linting of OpenGL Shading Language.
- [koihik.vscode-lua-format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Koihik.vscode-lua-format) - Lua code formatter.

#### Can I use [EmmyLua](https://github.com/EmmyLua/VSCode-EmmyLua) instead?
This is also a great option, and of course you can use it. The key difference is that `sunmeko.lua` can generate autocomplete *without* annotations.

#### Why not the built-in [mobdebug](https://github.com/pkulchenko/MobDebug)?
Unfortunately there is no the mobdebug extension for VSCode at this moment.

## Configuration

### Defold Path

Configure path to your Defold Editor folder in `.vscode/defold.sh`. `Java`, `bob`, `dmengine` and other necessary files are all extracted and used directly from your Defold Editor.

```bash
# The path to your Defold Editor folder:
# - MacOS: "/Applications/Defold.app"
# - Linux: "/usr/bin/Defold"
# - Windows: "C:/Program Files/Defold"
defold_editor_path="YOUR-DEFOLD-PATH-HERE"
```

### Custom Editor

To open source files from Defold directly in VSCode you need to set VSCode as the custom editor in Defold preferences by settings the path to your VSCode executable:

- MacOS: `/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron`
- Linux: `/usr/bin/code`
- Windows: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe`

Also set these parameters to open files from Defold correctly:

- Open File: `{file}`
- Open File at Line: `-g {file}:{line}`

#### MacOS only:

It's recommend to start VSCode with the project folder first and then open the source files from Defold, otherwise Defold will try to run VSCode with the Defold icon in the Dock as separate from original VSCode application.

### Defold API

Lua headers with Defold API are generated with [IntelliJ-Defold-Api](https://github.com/d954mas/IntelliJ-Defold-Api) by [d954mas](https://github.com/d954mas). You can update them by downloading `defold_api.zip` from the [releases](https://github.com/d954mas/IntelliJ-Defold-Api/releases) page and unarchive it to the `.defold_api` folder in your workspace.

![intellisense](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4752473/113480000-ca02fd00-949a-11eb-9194-f4e546faef93.gif)

### Libraries

To help the language server to find external libraries and parse their headers you need to unarchive the `*.zip` files in the `.internal/lib/` folder. This folder appears after the external libraries are fetched. Don't delete the archives themselves of course.

Unarchive only libraries without native extensions. If you want to unarchive a mixed library with a native extension and Lua modules, you will need to remove the native extension part after unarchiving, otherwise the build will fail.

### Settings

Use `.vscode/settings.json` as your VSCode settings. If you work with many Defold projects, then it would be reasonable to copy them to the user settings instead of workspace settings.

Some of settings are required for IntelliSense to work properly, but most of them just make your development with Lua and Defold much more comfortable.

### Git

There are `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files that should help your git to work more correctly with your Defold project.

### Formatting

To configure formatting rules edit `.vscode/lua-format.config` according to [these style options](https://github.com/Koihik/LuaFormatter/blob/master/docs/Style-Config.md).

## Tasks

VSCode tasks are available with shortcut **[Ctrl/Cmd]-Shift-B** by default.

![tasks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4752473/113480040-fcacf580-949a-11eb-8b8b-da39591373cb.gif)

- `Clean` the build folder. Runs bob with `distclean`.
- `Resolve` the dependencies by fetching them. Runs bob with `resolve`.
- `Build` for debugging. Runs bob with `--variant debug build`.
- `Bundle` for the selected platform with selecting `debug` or `release` variant.
- `Deploy` to the connected device with [ios-deploy](https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy) for iOS and [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) for Android. The tools must be installed and accessible via bash.

You can configure additional arguments for dependencies resolution and bundling on the top of `.vscode/defold.sh`.

## Debugger

Debugging is provided with [local-lua-debugger-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomblind.local-lua-debugger-vscode) by [tomblind](https://github.com/tomblind). The extension runs `dmengine` locally and interacts with it via `stdio`.

![debugger](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4752473/113479667-0897b800-9499-11eb-91c3-00eee42e83f2.gif)

To debug you also need to start the debugger on the game side:

```lua
local debugger = require('debugger.debugger')
debugger.start()
```

There are two launch configurations: `Build & Run` and `Just Run`. The only difference between them is launching of the building pre-task `bob: build`.

You can launch the selected configuration by shortcut **F5** by default.

## Logs

- Bob's tasks output logs to the Terminal tab.
- The game outputs logs to the Debug Console tab.

## Limitations

The path to Defold Editor cannot contain spaces right now. This is caused by the fact that bob cannot be run with spaces, see [defold/defold/#5930](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/5930).

There is no way to change breakpoints at runtime, only on pauses. Bind some key to call `debugger.requestBreak()` can be a great trick if you want to edit breakpoints at runtime but you don't have any breakpoints in the code at the moment. Watch [tomblind/local-lua-debugger-vscode/#32](https://github.com/tomblind/local-lua-debugger-vscode/issues/32) for updates.

Local Lua Debugger is a *local* debugger. So you can't debug the game on the device by this way.

**Hot reloading** is also available from the Defold Editor. Just select a runned localhost target in the *Project / Target* menu when the game is running.
